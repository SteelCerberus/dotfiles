#: Copy to clipboard on selecting text with mouse. Note that all applications can read the system clipboard,
#: meaning this is a security risk. At the least, clipboard control allows you to specify to ask for
#: persmission before a program running in Kitty reads from the clipboard.
copy_on_select yes
clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask

#: When the mouse hovers over a terminal hyperlink, show the actual
#: URL that will be activated when the hyperlink is clicked.
show_hyperlink_targets yes

#: Remove spaces at end of line when copying to clipboard; smart excludes rectangle selections
strip_trailing_spaces smart

#: Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In
#: addition to these characters any character that is marked as an
#: alphanumeric character in the Unicode database will be matched.
# select_by_word_characters @-./_~?&=%+#

#: Delay between screen updates in milliseconds. Default is about 100 FPS.
# repaint_delay 10

#: The audio bell. Useful to disable it in environments that require silence.
enable_audio_bell false

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.
window_padding_width 10


#: Potentially useful options for the background
# background_opacity 1.0
# background_blur 0
# background_image none
# background_image_layout cscaled
# background_image_linear no
# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set
# dim_opacity 0.4

#: Allow other programs to control kitty
allow_remote_control yes

#: Path to python file which will be loaded for watchers
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/#watchers>.
# watcher

# Can be used to control where (and the order) kitty finds programs to run
# exe_search_path

#: Send a notification when a command in an onfocused window running >15 seconds has finished
notify_on_cmd_finish unfocused 15.0 command notify-send "Job finished with status: %s" %c

#: Forward STDOUT and STDERR of the kitty process to child processes
#: as file descriptors 3 and 4. This is useful for debugging as it
#: allows child processes to print to kitty's STDOUT directly. For
#: example, echo hello world >&3 in a shell will print to the parent
#: kitty's STDOUT. When enabled, this also sets the
#: KITTY_STDIO_FORWARDED=3 environment variable so child processes
#: know about the forwarding.
# forward_stdio no

#: Default is to auto, but may as well force wayland
linux_display_server wayland

#: Typically used for inputting text in East Asian languages. However, its
#: implementation in Wayland is often buggy and introduces latency, so
#: you may want to disable it.
wayland_enable_ime yes

#: Open new OS window with the current working directory
map ctrl+q new_os_window_with_cwd

#: Send arbitrary text on key presses
#: Use `kitten show_key` to get the key escape codes you want to emulate
#: The first argument to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to
#: activate the shortcut. The possible values are normal,
#: application, kitty or a comma separated combination of them. 
#: E.g. map ctrl+shift+alt+h send_text all Hello World
#::  Some more examples::
#::      # Output a word and move the cursor to the start of the line (like typing and pressing Home)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\e[H
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\eOH
#::      # Run a command at a shell prompt (like typing the command and pressing Enter)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal,application some command with arguments\r




#: Everything below this is commented out documentation for potentially useful keybinds

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase Unicode characters.
#: For example: a for the A key, [ for the left square bracket key,
#: etc. For functional keys, such as Enter or Escape, the names are
#: present at Functional key definitions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#functional>.
#: For modifier keys, the names are ctrl (control, ⌃), shift (⇧), alt
#: (opt, option, ⌥), super (cmd, command, ⌘).

#: Simple shortcut mapping is done with the map directive. For full
#: details on advanced mapping including modal and per application
#: maps, see mapping <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/mapping/>. Some
#: quick examples to illustrate common tasks::

#:     # unmap a keyboard shortcut, passing it to the program running in kitty
#:     map kitty_mod+space
#:     # completely ignore a keyboard event
#:     map ctrl+alt+f1 discard_event
#:     # combine multiple actions
#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout
#:     # multi-key shortcuts
#:     map ctrl+x>ctrl+y>z action

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

# kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: Special modifier key alias for default shortcuts. You can change
#: the value of this option to alter all default shortcuts that use
#: kitty_mod.

# clear_all_shortcuts no

#: Remove all shortcut definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# action_alias

#: E.g. action_alias launch_tab launch --type=tab --cwd=current

#: Define action aliases to avoid repeating the same options in
#: multiple mappings. Aliases can be defined for any action and will
#: be expanded recursively. For example, the above alias allows you to
#: create mappings to launch a new tab in the current working
#: directory without duplication::

#:     map f1 launch_tab vim
#:     map f2 launch_tab emacs

#: Similarly, to alias kitten invocation::

#:     action_alias hints kitten hints --hints-offset=0

# kitten_alias

#: E.g. kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: Like action_alias above, but specifically for kittens. Generally,
#: prefer to use action_alias. This option is a legacy version,
#: present for backwards compatibility. It causes all invocations of
#: the aliased kitten to be substituted. So the example above will
#: cause all invocations of the hints kitten to have the --hints-
#: offset=0 option applied.

#: Clipboard {{{

#: Copy to clipboard

# map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard
# map cmd+c       copy_to_clipboard

#::  There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#::  mapped to Ctrl+C. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#::  send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly,
#::  copy_and_clear_or_interrupt will copy and clear the selection or
#::  send an interrupt if there is no selection.

#: Paste from clipboard

# map kitty_mod+v paste_from_clipboard
# map cmd+v       paste_from_clipboard

#: Paste from selection

# map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
# map shift+insert paste_from_selection

#: Pass selection to program

# map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program

#::  You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#::  program with pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#::  open program is used, but you can specify your own, the selection
#::  will be passed as a command line argument to the program. For
#::  example::

#::      map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#::  You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running
#::  in a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#::      map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

#: Scroll to bottom

# map kitty_mod+end scroll_end
# map cmd+end       scroll_end

#: Scroll to previous shell prompt

# map kitty_mod+z scroll_to_prompt -1

#::  Use a parameter of 0 for scroll_to_prompt to scroll to the last
#::  jumped to or the last clicked position. Requires shell
#::  integration <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/>
#::  to work.

#: Scroll to next shell prompt

# map kitty_mod+x scroll_to_prompt 1

#: Browse scrollback buffer in pager

# map kitty_mod+h show_scrollback

#::  You can pipe the contents of the current screen and history
#::  buffer as STDIN to an arbitrary program using launch --stdin-
#::  source. For example, the following opens the scrollback buffer in
#::  less in an overlay window::

#::      map f1 launch --stdin-source=@screen_scrollback --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

#::  For more details on piping screen and buffer contents to external
#::  programs, see launch <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/>.

#: Browse output of the last shell command in pager

# map kitty_mod+g show_last_command_output

#::  You can also define additional shortcuts to get the command
#::  output. For example, to get the first command output on screen::

#::      map f1 show_first_command_output_on_screen

#::  To get the command output that was last accessed by a keyboard
#::  action or mouse action::

#::      map f1 show_last_visited_command_output

#::  You can pipe the output of the last command run in the shell
#::  using the launch action. For example, the following opens the
#::  output in less in an overlay window::

#::      map f1 launch --stdin-source=@last_cmd_output --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

#::  To get the output of the first command on the screen, use
#::  @first_cmd_output_on_screen. To get the output of the last jumped
#::  to command, use @last_visited_cmd_output.

#::  Requires shell integration
#::  <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> to work.
